- I'm setting up this Logseq graph as a personal but public knowledge base. My main motivation is that I've been messing around with various bits of retro computing nonsense, and I've noticed that there aren't many really solid sources of knowledge. So, I'll record them here for myself, and publish them for anyone else who happens to care.
- I'll try publishing this blog via [[Github]] Pages using the official solution, [publish-spa](https://github.com/logseq/publish-spa). I don't much like the sound of the "SPA" part of that, but I'll take what I can get.
